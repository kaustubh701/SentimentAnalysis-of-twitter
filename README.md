# SentimentAnalysis-of-twitter
This project is based on entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.
In this project I used NLTK,tensorflow ,keras,scikitlearn,matplotlib,pandas and numpy libraries.I also used pre trained Nlp model textblob.I trained the model with neural network using dense and dropout layers. Thus i achieved a final accuracy  of 0.882.
